# WZTG Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the course "Selected
Topics in Graph Theory".

## Overview

The course covers various topics in graph theory, such as matchings, treewidth,
perfect graphs, colorings, expanders, and more. There were three assignments in
total, each consisting of four theoretical problems. Problem statements and
solutions are in English and provided as PDFs generated with LaTeX.

## Assignment Subjects

The assignments cover the following subjects:

1. Matchings, Treewidth, and Pathwidth
2. Spectral Graph Theory and the Grid Minor Theorem
3. Planar Graphs, Expanders, and Colorings

The solutions can be found in the respective directories. I solved 8 out of 12
problems.
